/// reason, this `NIOAsyncWebServerSocketUpgrader` only knows how to do the required parts of the upgrade and to
/// complete the handshake. Users are expected to provide a callback that examines the HTTP headers
/// (including the path) and determines whether this is a websocket upgrade request that is acceptable
/// to them.
///
/// This upgrader assumes that the `HTTPServerUpgradeHandler` will appropriately mutate the pipeline to
/// remove the HTTP `ChannelHandler`s.
